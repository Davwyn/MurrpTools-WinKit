   **Using Rufus**
   
   Rufus Tool is available at: https://rufus.ie
   
   **Reccomended setings for Rufus:**
      - Partition scheme: GPT
      - Target System: UEFI
      - File system: NTFS

        After you click 'Start' Rufus may prompt with 'Windows User Experience' (eg. Remove Requirements, Disable Bitlocker, etc.)

        Please uncheck all options. Enabling options could cause MurrpTools to fail loading Debloat Tools.`nMurrpTools will already include those features built-in.
